# Predicting Tesla Stock Price Movements

## Overview
This module explores the prediction of Tesla stock price movements using selected machine learning techniques, focusing on investors' sentiment as expressed in the comments section of Yahoo Finance. By analyzing sentiment scores alongside historical stock prices, we aim to identify patterns that may influence stock performance.

## Objectives
- To develop a robust model for predicting Tesla's stock price movements.
- To incorporate sentiment analysis of investor comments from Yahoo Finance.
- To evaluate the performance of different machine learning techniques in forecasting stock prices.

## Data Sources
- **Tesla Stock Prices**: Historical stock price data sourced from Yahoo Finance.
- **Investor Sentiment**: Comments collected from the Yahoo Finance platform, processed to generate sentiment scores.

## Methodology
1. **Data Collection**:
   - Gather historical stock prices and comments related to Tesla from Yahoo Finance.
   - Preprocess the data to align sentiment scores with corresponding stock prices.

2. **Sentiment Analysis**:
   - Utilize natural language processing (NLP) techniques to analyze comments and derive sentiment scores.
   - Calculate daily average sentiment scores to match the stock price data.

3. **Machine Learning Techniques**:
   - Implement various machine learning algorithms, including:
     - Linear Regression
     - Random Forest
     - Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) Networks

4. **Model Evaluation**:
   - Assess model performance using metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared.
   - Compare predictions against actual stock prices to determine accuracy.

## Results
- Presentation of key findings, including:
  - Performance metrics for each machine learning technique.
  - Insights into how investor sentiment correlates with stock price movements.
  - Recommendations for investors based on predictive outcomes.

## Conclusion
This project aims to provide investors with valuable insights into Tesla's stock price movements by leveraging sentiment analysis. By integrating machine learning techniques with market sentiment data, we hope to enhance decision-making processes for investors.
